Description: With understand of freedom of gene expression, we constructed a coordinate system to point expression state of S. cerevisiae in a high dimensional space. When the coordinate system was applied as bases of transcriptional state to represent experimental expression data, detailed expression difference between both replications and different experiments can be easily identified and visualized.
